# Interview-Tone-Analyzer-Project
AI-Powered Communication Feedback Tool

Built a machine learning app that analyzes users' interview audio to assess confidence, clarity, and filler word usage

Used OpenAI Whisper for accurate speech-to-text transcription; integrated PyTorch as the core deep learning framework

Implemented NLP techniques to detect filler words, speaking rate, and tone-related features for real-time feedback

Designed feedback reports to help users improve spoken delivery and professional communication skills

Demonstrated end-to-end AI pipeline: audio preprocessing → model inference → natural language analysis → user-facing insights
